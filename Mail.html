            <p>Dear Cameron,</p>
            I am Sarah from accounting. How are you and your Wife
            <input type="text" id="hint1"  class="tiny-input">?
            I heard you were on Holidays in
            <input type="text" id="hint2"  class="tiny-input"> last week; I knew you looked refreshed!<br>
            Why I am actually writing you is because I need your employee ID and department;
            our system failed AGAIN! And yours was one of the few accounts left to process, I am really under time pressure here and would greatly appreciate your help.<br>
            I am sorry to bother you with this; wish you the best.<br>
            <br>
            Sarah from Accounting
            <p>
